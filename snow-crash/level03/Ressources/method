#we can see that it has special permissions.
#these permissions mean that it is a setuid and setgid binary.
#using "ltrace ./level03" we can see that it calls "/usr/bin/env echo"
#any call made by a setuid binary will use that uid permissions for its calls
#by writing a fake echo binary and changing the PATH to force its use we can
#make any calls we like with the permissions of the uid set in the binary
