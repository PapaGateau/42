#a .pcap file can be found in the user directory
#these files are network packet snapshots used by Wireshark
#using secure copy (scp), we can copy it to our host system and inspect it
#from host:
scp -P 4242 level02@localhost:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap .

#after a prompt to enter level02 user password, the file is copied to host
#the file has insufficient permissions to open it in Wireshark
chmod 777 level02.pcap

#by using the follow TCP stream tool in Wireshark and showing the data as ASCII
#we can see a password string: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L
#however if we show the data as hexdump we can see that the '.' characters
#are 7F aka DEL. if we take these into account, we find the correct password
