Simple library of assembly functions for MacOS 64bit assembly using Intel syntax

Purpose: Introduction to assembly language
Goal: write a number of basic LIB-C functions using assembly
Skills acquired:
#Compiling asm and C
using assembly compiler nasm and gcc we can create objects from both languages
and link them together as a binary
nasm -f macho64 src_asm.s
gcc -c src_c.c -o src_c.o
gcc src_c.o src_asm.o -o binary
#Basic understanding of assembly language (The stack, how registers and instructions interact with it)
